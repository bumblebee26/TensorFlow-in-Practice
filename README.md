# TensorFlow in Practice (Specialization Course by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice?))

1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
2. Convolution Neural Networks in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction

In this four-course Specialization, I learned some exciting opportunities of AI applications. Beginning by developing an understanding of how to build and train neural networks. Improving a networkâ€™s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images. Teaching machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems. Learn to process text, represent sentences as vectors, and input data to a neural network.
